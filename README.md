# UFOs

# Overview
An In-depth Analysis of UFO sightings around the world.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse data around UFO sightings. 

- Step 1 Build a webpage that will allow users to view the data (HTML). 
- Step 2 Build a dynamic table that will present it (JavaScript).

NOTE: HTML and JavaScript elements were created simultaneously because they complemented each other. For example, the JavaScript table was referenced within the HTML code, and different HTML components were referenced within the JavaScript code. Because these files were so closely linked, the developer switched between building the JavaScript table (within the app.js file) and the HTML page (within an index.html file). 

- A table was built using data stored in a JavaScript array. Arrow functions (one of the most popular aspects of the ES6 update) were used.
- Filters were created to make the table fully dynamic, meaning that it reacts to user input.
- The table was placed into an HTML file for easy viewing.
- A Webpage was customized using Bootstrap. 

#### Challenge: 

The purpose of this challenge was to expand on the project completed during the module and use Javascript, HTML, and CSS to create a custom webpage that showcased different UFO sitings around the world and allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. The challenge consisted of one technical analysis deliverable and a written report as follows.

### Deliverable 1 - Filtered UFO Sightings on Multiple Criteria

Using JavaScript and HTML, the code was modified in the index.html file to create additional table filters for the city, state, country, and shape as shown below:

The handleClick() function was replaced in the app.js file with a new function that saved the element, value, and id of the filter that was changed above. A new function was created to loop through the dataset and keep only the results that match the search criteria. The webpage was updated with the search criteria.

### Deliverable 2 

For your written analysis, be sure to use complete and coherent sentences. Your written analysis should contain three sections, which cover the following:

## Results: 

Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

## Summary: 

In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
