# UFOs

# Overview
Use Javascript, HTML, and CSS to create a custom webpage that showcases different UFO sitings around the world.

## Purpose
In this module, you'll build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. You'll also create filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing.

You'll customize your webpage using Bootstrap, and equip your table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with our visualizations.

### Web Scraping Analysis:

Step 1 - Using Chrome Developer Tools (also known as DevTools) allows developers to look at the structure of any webpage.  Goal was to extract the most recently published article's title and summary from NASA news website.

The following chart represents the dates from the weather dataset and the total amount of precipitation for each day for all nine weather stations. The chart reveals some months have higher amounts of precipitation than others.

The following summary includes different statistics for the amount of precipitation in a year. The count is the number of times precipitation was observed. The other statistics are the precipitation amounts for each station for each day.

Out of the nine stations, the following shows the most active stations with precipitation recordings listed in descending order.

### Weather Station Analysis:
The most active station was Station ID USC00519281. The results show that the low (minimum) temperature is 54 degrees, the high (maximum) temperature is 85 degrees, and the average temperature is approximately 71.7 degrees.

Observed 12-month temperature data for Station ID USC00519281 (2772 observations) reveals a vast majority of the observations were over 67 degrees. Temperatures over 67 degrees were observed approximately 325 days over the twelve-month period.

# Challenge Summary

The following summary describes the key differences in weather between June and December and two recommendations for further analysis. As shown in the results, a surf and ice cream shop business would be sustainable year-round.

## Challenge Results: 

#### Summary Statistics for June

![June_statistics.png](https://github.com/KimberlyCrawford/Surfs_Up/blob/main/analysis/June_statistics.png) ![Fig3June.png](https://github.com/KimberlyCrawford/Surfs_Up/blob/main/analysis/Fig3June.png)
- The average temperature in June was slightly higher at 74.9 compared to 71.0 in December.
- The minimum temperature in June was slightly higher at 64 compared to 56 in December.
- The maximum temperature in June was slightly higher at 85 compared to 83 in December.

#### Summary Statistics for December

![December_statistics.png](https://github.com/KimberlyCrawford/Surfs_Up/blob/main/analysis/December_statistics.png) ![Fig4December.png](https://github.com/KimberlyCrawford/Surfs_Up/blob/main/analysis/Fig4December.png)
- The average temperature in December was slightly lower at 71.0 compared to 74.9 in June.
- The minimum temperature in December was slightly lower at 56 compared to 64 in June.
- The maximum temperature in December was slightly lower at 83 compared to 85 in June.

## Recommendations for Further Analysis: 
- Query 1 - Additional query to perform to gather more weather data for June and December should include a precipitation analysis especially with June starting hurricane season.
- Query 2 - Additional query to perform to gather more weather data for June and December should include a refined list of temperatures based on various times of the day.
